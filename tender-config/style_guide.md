# Tri‑Tender Dynamic Style Guide

This file acts as a **summary** of the brand style for the current project.
The AI must **generate or update** this content from the company's own documents,
not use a fixed template style.

## 1. Tone of Voice

- Base tone must be derived from:
  - Company profiles.
  - Previous proposals.
  - Website or marketing material (if provided).
- Capture:
  - Level of formality (e.g. very formal / professional but approachable / conversational).
  - Typical phrases or terminology used by the company.
  - Any industry jargon they favour.

> **AI:** Never copy this style guide from another project.  Rebuild it fresh
> per company.

## 2. Visual & Layout Preferences

- Infer preferred layout and presentation from:
  - Existing company proposals or reports.
  - Corporate identity manuals, if available.
- Decide:
  - Heading style (compact vs spacious).
  - Use of tables versus paragraphs.
  - Preference for bullets versus narrative text.

The AI may:
- Choose between different layout “archetypes” (classic, modern minimal, technical) per company.
- Use different heading wording and ordering as long as tender rules are still met.

## 3. Colour & Branding

- Extract brand colours from any:
  - Brand manuals.
  - Logos or existing templates.
- If colours are not explicit, infer them from:
  - Logo colours.
  - Website screenshots or descriptions.

> **Note:** Colours and branding must be **project‑specific**.  No default colour
> scheme should be reused blindly across different users.
